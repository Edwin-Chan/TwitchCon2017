  This project is Facial Recognition Overlay for the Twitch streaming service. We use an API to track the face of the streamer on the screen and register the emotion of the streamer. Based on the emotion we detect, a different animation will pop up. The main feature of this is called a salt meter. As a player's "anger" emotion increases, a meter will appear on the screen and track the amount of "saltiness" of the player. 
  We accomplishe this through java and html by parsing data from a java program into a javascript capable html link, which we then used as a constantly refreshing overlay for twitch streaming accounts. This program is a twitch extention.
